======================LOGIN.JS======================

There are two ways to store inputs. 1) useState 2) with useRef.

When we click on Signin button it tries to submit the form, which causes the page reload. To avoid this use e.preventDefault() at click handler.

Since I know how useRef works I wont be noting it.

useRef is used to reference a element in the dom . (Many other usecases he didn't tell , I know about it after working in KB)
